On the c10.1 branch is a semi working device tree for hp tenderloin cm10.1. This is the same as b10.1 but the camera commit are reverted because they used too much power (90mA sleep vs 20mA sleep)
NOTE: This is almost identical to cm10.1-ugly but it isn't as ugly. I split the big cm10.1 commit into several, separate, explained commits. I plan to do all further work on this branch. Forgive my errors, I am new to git and github. 
It is a work in progress. Very much a WIP. 

Camera is gone for now. 
I don't think bluetooth works. We need a bluedroid config file among other stuff.

Now we have sound! Thanks again to James Sullins. 

but...
the SDCARD is mounted now! Thanks to James Sullins, aka jcsullins (who also made most of the other commits that get this working).

This is heavily reliant on the work of Arne Coucheron.
His invaluable patches include:
Not needed anymore: http://review.cyanogenmod.org/#/c/34375
http://review.cyanogenmod.org/#/c/34377/
http://review.cyanogenmod.org/#/c/34374/
and his highly useful doc:

Without his work, I would still have no display.

Here's the local_manifest.xml (local_manifests/roomservice.xml) file I use:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<manifest>
  <project name="drmarble/android_device_hp_tenderloin" path="device/hp/tenderloin" remote="github" revision="c10.1" />

  <project name="arco/android_hardware_qcom_media-legacy" path="hardware/qcom/media-legacy" remote="github" revision="cm-10.1" /> 
</manifest>

Actually, I clone my repo into device/hp/tenderloin. https://github.com/drmarble/android_device_hp_tenderloin.git
(You know where it is or you wouldn't be able to read this). I included it in the local manifest here for your convenience.

I think that this is everything. 
If you figure out how to fix something like bluetooth (I don't own any), let me know on freenode cyanogenmod-tenderloin, RootzWiki, or XDA.
